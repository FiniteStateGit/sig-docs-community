name: SIG Reviewer/Maintainer Nomination Template
about: Nominate yourself or someone else to become a SIG reviewer or maintainer
title: 'SIG Reviewer/Maintainer Nomination'
---

The Documentation and Community SIG maintains two reviewer roles requiring SIG approval: *Documentation reviewer* and *technical reviewer*. Documentation reviewers review for conformance with the [style guide](https://o3de.org/docs/contributing/to-docs/style-guide/), appropriateness of content, and other subjective factors to keep documentation content aligned. Technical reviewers review for technical accuracy alone: They make sure that described steps, features, file formats, code examples, and other parts of documentation that are deeply technical match the _current_ product state.

For more on the Reviewer and Maintainer roles, read our [Community Membership](https://github.com/o3de/community/blob/main/community-membership.md) information.
